# Abalone-Age-Prediction
The original stated problem is estimate the age an abalone, which can be determined from the number of rings in their shell.  However, counting the number of rings in an abalone shell is an expensive method. Thus, one possible solution is predict the number of rings of an abalone from characteristics like height, diameter, lenght and weight measurements.
